# Global-AI-Hub-project-1

This repository includes a project generated during Global AI Hub Python Bootcamp.

In this project, I was asked to create a student grading system. 

**Requirements of the project:**

* Choose a lesson for yourself. (Math, Physics, Linear Algebra etc.)

* Create your note range (100-80 ⇒ A, 79-70 ⇒ B etc.)

* Create a system where you can enter Student Information (Name, Surname, School Number, exam score) and keep this information.

* Based on the information entered, the student must show whether or not he has passed the course.

* If the student has passed the course, the text "Passed" should be shown in the field where the student's information is kept, and "Failed" if the student   has not passed the course.

* Create a Dataframe that shows the students whose grades have been entered, who passed the course and those who did not.

* Convert the created Dataframe to an Excel table.


!! While working on this project I tried to use Object-oriented programming (OOP).
